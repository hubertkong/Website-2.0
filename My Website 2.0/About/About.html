            <strong>Hello, welcome to my website.</strong> I developed this website with the extra free time I had
            during the 2020 novel-corona-virus pandemic. I hope you all are keeping well and being safe. <br><br>

            <strong>A bit about the website:</strong> The languages that I used were mainly html and css along with a
            bit of sass. The ide that I used was Webstorm by Jet-Brains. The code was pushed through git-hub and
            hosted by netlify. <br><br>

            <strong>I am a current student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a bachelor of commerce degree. </strong>
            My expected graduation year will be 2023. During the following three years I will be studying a specialist
            in accounting and pursuing a minor in statistics. <br><br>

            <strong>I am a Canadian-born-chinese (CBC).</strong> I was born in Toronto (Mt. Sina hospital) and grew up
            in Oakville(GTA). I went to White Oaks Secondary School and completed the International Baccalaureate program
            there. To be fully honest, coming out of high-school I didn't know what I wanted to do. I applied to
            practically all the disciplines of education (engineering, business, science, etc.). I found myself blindly
            choosing business. In the end, I found myself in an introductory accounting course. <strong>I loved it. </strong>
            Moral of the story, it's ok not having your life planned out or not knowing what you want to do. <strong>Life is to
            be lived and explored</strong> <br><br>

            <strong>I love basketball. </strong> I played the sport since middle school and continue to play it recreationally.
            If you share the same love for the sport, please let me know what you think about the upcoming drafts or season outcomes! <br><br>

            <strong> I created this website to expand my network, so please do share it with friends and family.</strong>
            I am looking to engage with many new people and make new friends. You can contact me using any of
            the options on the contact page. Feel free to reach out and talk about anything!<br><br>

            <strong>Thank you for taking time out of your day to visit my website. </strong> <br>I hope you have a wonderful
            day!
        </p>
